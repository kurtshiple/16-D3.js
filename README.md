# D3-and-Data-Journalism-on-US-Census-Information
The purpose of this project was to get familiarized with D3 visualization techniques by creating a multidimensional scatter plot that would take U.S. demographic data on healthcare % and poverty %.

Using D3 techniques the scatter plot represents each state with circle elements that have state abbreviations in the circles. This graphic is coded in the app.js file of the project directory and the data is pulled from data.csv by using the d3.csv function.

Note: This project needs to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
